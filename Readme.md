# Terraform Learning

  This repository is a collection of tutorials that I have been taking to learn how to deploy infrastructure as code 
using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) in [AWS](http://console.aws.amazon.com).

## Structure
 Inside each folder you can find more information about the content of the tutorials and the source.
 
 * `vpc_and_ec2`: Source code for [VPC Solutions with EC2 for Production: AWS with Terraform](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/vpc-solutions-ec2-production-aws-terraform-video).
