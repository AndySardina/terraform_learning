# Video Tutorial [VPC Solutions with EC2 for Production: AWS with Terraform](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/vpc-solutions-ec2-production-aws-terraform-video)

  
### Description 

In the PacktPub website, you will find the following description:

> This course will help you learn how to implement production-ready infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and 
Terraform. You will not only understand how to implement Terraform code but also an AWS Well-Architected
 Framework-recommended deployment model which will be highly available, scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient.

> This course starts by exploring the tools you'll need throughout the course, including a mandatory IDE and AWS account. 
You will also be guided on how to get an AWS account if you do not already have one. Next, you’ll learn to set up 
environment variables for Terraform deployments and configure your IDE to use Terraform efficiently by installing a
Terraform plugin. In addition to this, you’ll implement your remote state and obtain a key pair, which you can use to
connect to the instances you launch. After this, you will go on to create a virtual private cloud (VPC) environment.
As you progress, you’ll be able to attach an internet gateway (IGW) to the VPC for use with public subnets, so their
resources will be able to access and receive public internet traffic. Toward the concluding sections, you’ll understand 
how to implement your launch configurations for the public and private EC2 instances, and launch through Auto Scaling 
groups. Finally, you will use Target Tracking Scaling to scale and manage your EC2 instances effectively.

## Structure of this folder
In this repository you will find two folders:

 * `initial`: It contains the original implementation that is discussed in the tutorial. 
 * `improvements`: It contains a refactoring of the original implementation using the new features of 
 Terraform 0.12.
